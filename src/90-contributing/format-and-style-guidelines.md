# Style guide

This chapter describes the style guide for our documentation. We will cover the conventions 
for writing the technical documentation.


## Organization

The documentation is divided into **books**, **parts** (labeled `part:`), **chapters** (labeled `chapter:`), 
and **sections** (labeled `sec:`).

The structure of each book is stored inside the `src/_toc.yml` file.

## General guidelines for technical writing

The following holds for all technical writing.

- The documentation is written in correct English.

- The words "should" and "must" are not interchangeable, they have precise meanings;[^rfc2119]

[^rfc2119]: These meanings are explained [in this document](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

- "Please" is unnecessary in technical documentation;
  ```{admonition} Wrong
  :class: danger

  "Please remove the SD card."
  ```
  
  ```{admonition} Better
  :class: success

  "Remove the SD card."
  ```

- Do not use colloquialisms or abbreviations;
  ```{admonition} Wrong
  :class: danger

  "The pwd is `ubuntu`."
  ```

  ```{admonition} Better
  :class: success

  "The password is `ubuntu`."
  ```


- Python is capitalized when used as a name;
  ```{admonition} Wrong
  :class: danger
  
  "If you are using python..."
  ```
  
  ```{admonition} Better
  :class: success
  
  "If you are using Python..."
  ```



- Do not use contracted forms;
  ```{admonition} Wrong
  :class: danger
  
  it's
  ```

  ```{admonition} Better
  :class: success
  
  it is
  ```


- Do not use emojis;

- Do not use **ALL CAPS**;

- Make infrequent use of **bold statements**;

- Do not use exclamation points;



## Style guide for the Duckietown documentation

- The English version of the documentation is written in American English;
  ```{admonition} Incorrect
  :class: danger
  
  behaviour
  ```

  ```{admonition} Correct
  :class: success
  
  behavior
  ```

- All the filenames and commands must be enclosed in code blocks using Markdown backticks;
  ```{admonition} Incorrect
  :class: danger
  
  "Edit the ~/.ssh/config file using nano."
  ```

  ```{admonition} Correct
  :class: success
  
  "Edit the `~/.ssh/config` file using `nano`."
  ```

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>, `ssh`, etc. are not verbs;
  ```{admonition} Incorrect
  :class: danger
  
  "<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> from the command line."
  ```

  ```{admonition} Correct
  :class: success
  
  "Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> from the command line."
  ```

- Subtle humor and puns about duckies are encouraged.

Do make use of the necessary complexity to convey your message, but do not hide behind overly complex language to disguise flaws. Remember Einstein’s quote:

> You don’t really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.

```{admonition} Examples

provide → give

query → question

in order to → to

utilize → use
```

## Frequently misspelled words

- "Duckiebot" is always capitalized.

- Use "Raspberry Pi", not "PI", "raspi", etc.

- These are other words frequently misspelled:

  5 GHz
  WiFi


## Other conventions

When the user must edit a file, just say: "edit `/this/file`".

Writing down the command line for editing, like the following:

    vi /this/file

is too much detail. Only specify the editor to use if the task at hand requires 
functionalities that are only available on a specific editor.


## Troubleshooting sections

Write the documentation as if every step succeeds.

Then, at the end, make a "Troubleshooting" section.

Organize the troubleshooting section as a list of symptom/resolution.

The following is an example of a troubleshooting section.


### Troubleshooting

Use the [`{trouble}` directive](language-format-troubleshooting) to declare troubleshooting
steps. For example,

```{trouble}
This strange thing happens.
---
Maybe the camera is not inserted correctly. Remove and reconnect.
```
